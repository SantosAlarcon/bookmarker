**Bookmarker** is a bookmark manager that lets you manage your bookmarks and folders everywhere, whatever you are in mobile or your PC.

# Used technologies

- **NextJS** (for the frontend and backend)
- **Zustand** (global state management)
- **Supabase** (for the database and authentication)
- **Sonner** (to render good looking notifications)

<br>

# Folder structure

- **mock** - Used to store JSON data and will be removed when the database implementation is completed
- **pages** - Used to render API routes
- **public** - Static content like images and stuff
- **src** - Most of the code is stored here, with the components, store, utilities and types
- **tests** - Unit and E2E testing

## ️⚠️ Warning

This project is in WIP, but you can log in and log out without problem. What you can't do at the moment is managing the bookmarks until I implemented the database operations.
